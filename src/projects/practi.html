    <h2>Practi</h2>
    <p>Practi is the next generation Point of Sale system, currently available in Israel and United Kingdom. It features a new cash register with a slick, intuitive and fast touch-enabled user interface on iPad. The iPad app is supported with a back office web interface supporting both mobile and desktop clients. The system - apart from sales - allows for managing inventory, tracking employees time, managing locations, updating product catalogue. One has also an easy way to keep an eye on his business performance through various reports and dashboard with key performance indicators.</p>
    <p>Bright Inventions inherited the project at the early stage and is heavily engaged in its rapid growth since then. We mastered various hardware integration aspects (printers, barcode scanners, credit card swipers, cash drawers, beacons etc.). We are also probably the best right-to-left writing systems specialists in our region. We are responsible for all parts of the system - the iPad app, the backend and the web panel.</p>
