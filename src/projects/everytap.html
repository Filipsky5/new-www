    <h2>Everytap</h2>
    <p>Everytap is an innovative loyalty program for iOS & Android platforms using iBeacon technology for collecting and spending points and notifying user about new events and promotions.</p> 
    <p>Bright Inventions bootstrapped the implementation on both platforms. Our work included - but was not limited to - plenty custom animations and UI effects as well as integrating push notifications, Google Maps and Facebook.</p>
