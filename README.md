# Bright WWW

## Develop

```
npm install
npm start
```

Running locally at [http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3001/)

## Deploy

Site is served directly from `gh-pages` branch. It's convenient to clone it separately directly into `dist` folder.

```
git clone -b gh-pages https://github.com/bright/new-www.git dist
npm run build
cd dist
git add . && git commit && git push
```
